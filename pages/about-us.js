        <p className='mt-6'>There are millions of cryptocurrencies out there with thousands being created every single day.
There are websites like coinmarketcap where you can see most of them, but with the rise of WEB3.0 in the shape and form of Internet Computer there is a new must for one that hosts only projects that are truely what blockchain, decentralization and web3.0 is.
</p>
        <p className='mt-4'>Here comes ICPTOKENS.NET distinguishing itself by uncompromising attention to detail and user experience. Here you WILL have it all. All ICP everything.</p>
        <p className='mt-4'>{"Our team is more than dedicated to craft and supply the users with everything their hearts truly desire, focusing on community and the dream for uniformity. Gradually, we aim to shift towards becoming a self-sustaining project that brings to life the collective ideas of its members. This evolution will transform us into an autonomous entity driven forward by the community itself. By doing so, we not only provide data on ICP tokens but also foster an environment where every user can contribute to and influence the ecosystem's growth."}</p>
        <p className='mt-4'>Our mission is to stand out, not just through the many services we will be releasing, but by the laser-focused democratic approach of the platform itself and how it evolves into a community driven project.</p>
